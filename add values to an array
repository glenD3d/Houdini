// Create an array, add values to the array that are on individual 'Points', 'Primitives', or 'Vertex'.
// For this example the values are on 'Points', on an attribute called 'total_array_sum'. We are going to place 
// the individual values on each point and put it into an array.
// Example: point 0 has a value of 1.33, point 1 has a value of 15.8, point 2 has a value of 4.66, etc. We are going
// to put each of these values into one array.
// Reading the point attribute: We get the type, which is point, the 0 is the first input, "total_array_sum" is the attribute, i is the iteration which we
// declare as i <= (less than or equal) @numpt which is the number of total points.
